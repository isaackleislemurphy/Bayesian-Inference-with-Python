## To-dos before Wednesday 1/29/2020

1. Download Anaconda and create an empty jupyter notebook

2. Recall key programming tasks in MATH 347 Bayesian Statistics and think about what you need to know to complete these tasks with Python. Programming tasks include but not limited to: 

    - generate random draws from a known distribution
    - plot a graph with generated draws
    - write a loop
    - write a function
    - write a Gibbs sampler
    
3. Create and maintain a jupyter notebook to record your progress

4. Check out the posted GibbsExample.ipynb and compare it to the posted F19MATH347_GibbsMCMC_R.pdf (pages 4-6), and please help out debugging the GibbsExample.ipynb code!

## To-dos before Wednesday 2/5/2020

1. Explore how to write a loop correctly (should we do range(0, S-1) or something else?). Note that one row contains 0's only as of right now.

2. Explore different plotting methods, including density plots, scatter plots etc.

3. Reproduce MATH 347 Lab 1 in a juptyer notebook. Please use markdown cells for texts (use appropriate markdown syntax for headings, equations etc.) and use code cells for Python scripts.
