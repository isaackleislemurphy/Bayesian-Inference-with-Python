## To-dos before Wednesday 1/29/2020

1. Download Anaconda and create an empty jupyter notebook

2. Recall key programming tasks in MATH 347 Bayesian Statistics and think about what you need to know to complete these tasks with Python. Programming tasks include but not limited to: 

    - generate random draws from a known distribution
    - plot a graph with generated draws
    - write a loop
    - write a function
    - write a Gibbs sampler
    
3. Create and maintain a jupyter notebook to record your progress
